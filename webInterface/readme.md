# DesignProject II

### Overview of System
The purpose of this project was to develop a system that can capture and analyze gestures performed by the user in order to control or provide inputs to a variety of different devices.
This system was constructed to improve upon conventional methods of controlling devices by making the experience more natural for the user. 

#### The system can be broken down into 2 Core Components
+ Web Application			// Contains entire application to handle users, devices and applications
	+ Written using PHP (PEAR Coding Standards Adhered To)
	+ Front-end powered by HTML, CSS and JS

+ Arduino Program			// Contains the codebase that is to be deployed to an arduino

### Setup
